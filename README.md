## Welcome to the OpenROM website.
OpenROM is an open-source operating system ROM build for the BBC Microbit.

### Input

Input in OpenROM was hard to think of with _only two_ buttons on the main board.

```

For more details see [the github repo](https://github.com/chardida/openrom-microbit-v1).

### Why?
OpenROM is almost a shell for the micro:bit. It is easy to use but the code is small enough for people to go in and tinker about in there, if they make a fork.
